	Project Title:
	Our project is based on the idea of OPAC(Online Pblic Access Catalog).
	OPAC is our college library website through which we can get information about different course and non-course books. 
	Through this website you can also reserve books without going to the library. 
	Our project brings the same functionality in the form of an application. 

	Tech-Stack Used:
	Built with: Android Studio
	Database used: Firebase,SQLite3
	Languages Used: JSON,XML,JAVA

	Features:
	In our app the user first sign up using their id after which he/she can search for different kind of books and can filter  them according to their needs. 
	They can reserve books easily through the app, can navigate through differnet features of OPAC easily and will get notified once their reserved book is available.
